// Two types of javascript 

// 1. Primitive (call by value)
  // there are 7 types included in primitive datatypes :
  // Number,String,null,undefined,BigInt,Bolean,symbol

// 2. Non-primitive (call by reference)
 // array , objects , functions 


//  // dynamically typed language
// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language,
//  which means that data types of variables are determined by the value
//   they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program 
//   as we assign different values to them. //
